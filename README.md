This file creates a Skip list, which is essentially a series of linked lists that are stacked on top of each other. The top of the skip list contains no numerical elements, and the bottom contains all the inserted elements. As you traverse up levels, certain elements will be eliminated. This skiplist contains the search, insert, and delete functionality.
